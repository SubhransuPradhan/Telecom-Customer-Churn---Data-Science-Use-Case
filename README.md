# Telecom-Customer-Churn---Data-Science-Use-Case
## ABSTRACT
Telecom churn prediction is the process of using data analytics and machine learning techniques to identify customers who are likely to cancel their service with a telecom company. The objective is to proactively target these at-risk customers with retention campaigns or other interventions before they leave. The input data for churn prediction can include demographic information, call history, billing information, customer usage patterns, and interactions with customer service. The output is a churn prediction score for each customer, indicating the likelihood that they will cancel their service. By reducing churn, telecom companies can improve customer loyalty, reduce customer acquisition costs, and increase revenue.
